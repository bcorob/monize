# Backup and restore contract

What a Monize backup promises, what it deliberately does not, and where the
boundaries are. Written because these guarantees were spread across five files
and a set of assumptions, and the gaps between them were where the defects lived:
an audit found a backup that could not be restored, attachments that came back
pointing at nothing, and a de-identified artifact carrying a user's name.

Read this before changing anything under `backend/src/backup/`.

For what was done about each audit finding that produced these rules -- including
the ones deliberately left open -- see the issues those findings were filed as
(#1069, #1070, #1071, #1073) and, for the full response, the audit branch's
`claude/detailed-error-review-4pbug7:docs/audit-phase-3-response.md`. That path is
branch-qualified on purpose: it is not a claim about this tree, and the doc-path
guard reads it as such.

## 0. Where the code lives

`BackupService` is a facade, not the implementation. Issue #1092 split the
original 2,600-line class into four components, each of which owns one of the
concerns this document describes:

| File | Owns |
|---|---|
| `backend/src/backup/backup.service.ts` | The facade the controller, the auto-backup cron and the support export call. One delegation per method, no decisions. |
| `backend/src/backup/backup-export.service.ts` | §1 and §4's export half: the `REPEATABLE READ` snapshot, the streamed and buffered assemblies, the carried attachment bytes, the completeness report. |
| `backend/src/backup/export-cursor.ts` | §6's bounded reads: the database cursor every export table is fetched through, and the batch sizes. |
| `backend/src/backup/export-json-stream.ts` | The document, assembled one row at a time under a chunk budget (and the in-memory collection the support export needs). |
| `backend/src/backup/export-attachments.ts` | The completeness audit that holds no bytes, and the external objects carried one at a time. |
| `backend/src/backup/export-writer.ts` | gzip, the encrypted container, backpressure, and unwinding when the client leaves. |
| `backend/src/backup/backup-envelope.ts`, `backup-stream-crypto.ts` | The encrypted-backup format: both container versions, and the framed one's writer and reader. |
| `backend/src/backup/backup-restore.service.ts` | §3 and §6: the processing gate, decryption, decompression, format validation, re-authentication ordering, id remapping, and the one transaction the rest runs inside. |
| `backend/src/backup/backup-attachment-transfer.service.ts` | §4's restore half: staging carried bytes, the legacy ownership proof, and both object-store cleanup paths. |
| `backend/src/backup/backup-restore-database.service.ts` | The restore's SQL: teardown, currency preparation, row inserts, deferred-FK repair. |
| `backend/src/backup/backup-format.ts` | The file format itself -- version, `BackupData`, the two result types -- shared by all four. |
| `backend/src/backup/export-table-queries.ts` | §2's other half: what is read, in what order, and what is deliberately not read. |
| `backend/src/backup/restore-plan.ts` | §2: insertion order and deferred foreign keys, as data. |

The split is why §4's ordering rule is reviewable at all: the object store is
touched from exactly one of these files, and the transaction is opened in exactly
one other.

## 1. What travels in a backup

Everything the export produces, in one gzipped JSON document with a
`version`/`exportedAt` envelope. Coverage is not a judgement call: the guard test
in `backend/test/integration/backup-restore.integration.spec.ts` fails unless
every live table is either exported or named in
`INTENTIONALLY_EXCLUDED_TABLES` with a reason.

**Included and complete:**

- Every user-owned table in `RESTORE_PLAN` (`backend/src/backup/restore-plan.ts`).
- Attachment **metadata** for every provider.
- Attachment **bytes** for every provider, base64-encoded in `attachment_blobs`.
  (This said "only for the `database` provider" long after section 4 stopped
  being true of it.) See section 4.
- Every currency definition the user's data references, whoever created it —
  not just the ones they created. Currencies are shared, and a code without its
  definition means the restore invents a name, symbol and decimal places.
- AI provider API keys, **decrypted**, in `api_key_plaintext`
  (`backend/src/backup/ai-provider-key-transport.ts`). `api_key_enc` is
  ciphertext under `AI_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, which is server configuration and cannot
  travel — shipping the master key beside the ciphertext would make encrypting
  the column pointless — so the key is decrypted on the way out and re-encrypted
  on the way in under whichever key the receiving instance holds. The exported
  row's `api_key_enc` is nulled: one secret, one representation.

  **The artifact therefore holds third-party credentials in the clear.** A backup
  encrypted with the user's password is fine; an unencrypted export (an OIDC
  account that has set no backup password) and an unencrypted automatic backup on
  disk are not, and `BackupExportService` logs when it writes one. The support
  (de-identified) backup drops `ai_provider_configs` outright
  (`support-backup-rules.ts`) and must keep doing so.

  A key the exporting instance cannot itself decrypt travels as ciphertext,
  unchanged — that is the pre-transport behaviour, so an artifact is never worse
  than the one this replaced, and a restore back onto the instance that wrote it
  still works.

**Deliberately excluded**, each for a stated reason in
`INTENTIONALLY_EXCLUDED_TABLES`: the `users` row itself, credentials and sessions,
the undo log, regenerable AI caches, global `exchange_rates`, cross-user sharing
and emergency-access configuration, and import working state.

### The export is one snapshot

Every table is read inside a single `REPEATABLE READ` transaction
(`inExportSnapshot`). This is not an optimisation. With a transaction per table,
a backup taken while the user was active could contain a transaction whose
account was created after the `accounts` query ran — a file that verifies, gzips
correctly, and fails on restore with a foreign-key violation. READ COMMITTED is
not sufficient even as a single transaction: it takes a fresh snapshot per
statement.

The cost is one pooled connection and a held `xmin` for the duration — for the
streaming export, the duration of the download. That is the price of a backup
that restores.

## 2. Ordering is data, not a sequence of calls

`restore-plan.ts` declares three things:

- `RESTORE_PLAN` — the insertion order, and whether `user_id` is forced.
- `DEFERRED_FK_COLUMNS` — columns stripped on insert because they point forward
  or at the row's own table.
- `DEFERRED_FK_REPAIRS` — the Phase-3 `UPDATE`s that put them back.

`restore-plan.spec.ts` parses every foreign key out of `database/schema.sql` and
proves no restored table references a table inserted later, or itself, unless the
column is stripped and repaired. It also fails on a deferred column that names no
real FK (a rename), a strip with no repair (a silently dropped link), and a repair
with no strip.

**A migration that adds a foreign key between two backed-up tables must keep that
test green.** `accounts.linked_loan_account_id` is why the test exists: a
self-referential FK from migration 093 that nobody added to the deferred list, so
every user who linked a property to its mortgage held a valid backup that could
not be restored — and nothing said so until the restore ran.

## 3. Rejection happens before the destruction

A restore deletes everything the user owns and then inserts the backup, in one
transaction. Everything that can refuse the request must refuse it before the
delete:

- decryption;
- decompression, under a hard expanded-size ceiling (section 6);
- version and envelope validation;
- re-authentication (section 5);
- **staging of external attachment objects** (section 4).

That list is in execution order, and the position of re-authentication is a
decision rather than an accident: it is last among the refusals because the OIDC
artifact is single-use and minting a replacement costs the user their file
selection, so nothing that can fail for free may fail *after* it. Section 5 has
the reasoning. What the ordering must never become is re-authentication after any
write — the check precedes every `DELETE FROM` on every path.

Any SQL or foreign-key error rolls the whole transaction back. The one effect
that is not transactional is the object store; that is what makes staging-first
necessary rather than merely tidy.

## 4. Attachments: the bytes travel

**A backup that cannot restore an attachment is not a backup of it.** That
sentence took four attempts to arrive at, and it is the whole of this section.

For the `database` provider the bytes were always in the artifact, base64 in
`attachment_blobs`. For `local` and `s3` they were not: the artifact carried
metadata, and the operator was told to restore the sidecar volume or bucket
alongside it. Every problem below follows from that split, and the fix is to end
it — **the export now reads every external object and carries it in
`attachment_blobs` too** (`externalAttachmentRows`), for all three export
paths.

That makes the artifact self-sufficient, which has three consequences:

- **Recovery works where it has to.** A fresh instance, and an account whose
  attachment metadata was deleted, both restore. Under the previous design neither
  could: the restore has to prove the caller may read an object before reading it,
  the only available proof was a current `transaction_attachments` row, and in both
  those cases there is no such row. So the two situations backups exist for were
  precisely the two that returned success with the attachments counted as skipped.
- **No authority question arises.** The bytes are inside a file the user
  downloaded, so there is nothing to authorize. This is what the rest of this
  section spent two rounds failing to achieve with checks on uploaded fields.
- **The provider is the target's decision.** A backup taken under `local` restores
  onto a `database` deployment and vice versa; the bytes land wherever this runtime
  keeps them and `storage_provider` is rewritten to match. Both directions used to
  be an unrestorable skip.

What it costs, stated plainly: artifacts are larger. What it no longer costs is
memory. The export used to accumulate every carried object as base64 in one array
before serialising — thirty 10 MiB receipts are ~400 MiB of text on a pod the
chart sizes at 400 MiB — and each object is now opened, written and dropped one
at a time (§6). The bytes still have to travel for the backup to be a backup;
they no longer have to be resident all at once.

**An omitted or inconsistent object does not silently pass as a complete backup
(F3R7-001).** An object the store cannot produce is logged and omitted — the ledger
is the point, and one unreadable receipt must not cost the user the whole file — but
the artifact is then **incomplete**, and the export says so. Every buffered export
returns a `BackupCompletenessReport`: how many attachment rows were expected, how
many had their bytes, how many were missing or (for the database provider,
`auditAttachments`) inconsistent with their metadata. The auto-backup
path acts on it — a partial artifact is written so the ledger is captured, but it is
**never promoted to weekly/monthly, never given a complete artifact's filename, and
never counted as one by retention**, so it cannot displace or age out a complete
copy, and its status is `partial`, not `success`. A later complete backup resumes
normal promotion and retention. This is the invariant that a backup shown as
successful is one that restores in full; section 7 has the on-disk half of it.

**The claim travels inside the artifact too (F3RB-001, issue #1069).** Every
buffered and streamed export writes a `completeness` member into the envelope,
beside `version` and `exportedAt`, holding the same report. Completeness used to
live only in `auto_backup_settings.lastBackupStatus`, which is state on the instance
that produced the file: copy the artifact elsewhere, restart, or find it in a
directory rescan, and a partial one was indistinguishable from a complete one. A
restore reads it back through `parseArtifactCompleteness` and logs what cannot come
back from that file — it does not refuse, because restoring a partial artifact is
usually the whole point and the alternative on offer is nothing. Three states, not
two: `complete: true`, `complete: false`, and **absent**, which means the artifact
predates the field and makes no claim at all. Absent is never read as "incomplete".

**The verdict is reached before the first byte, and without holding the bytes.**
The completeness report is produced by an audit (`auditAttachments`) that runs
inside the export snapshot ahead of the body: for the `database` provider,
Postgres computes `octet_length` and `sha256` over each blob and only the digests
travel; for `local`/`s3`, each object is opened, checked and dropped. Because both
passes read the same `REPEATABLE READ` snapshot, the database half of the verdict
is a fact rather than a forecast. The external half costs one extra read of each
object — the deliberate price of knowing the answer before the download starts,
and it trades bounded work for bounded memory rather than the other way round. An
object that changes between the two passes is caught again by the second and
logged; the artifact never carries an object the headers said was missing.

**A `sha256` and a `byte_size` are checked against the carried bytes**, at both
ends. One comparison, `attachmentBytesConsistent` (`attachment-integrity.util.ts`),
used from both ends with different provenance — and `attachmentDigestConsistent`
beneath it, so the audit's SQL-computed digest goes through the same judgement
rather than restating it in SQL. At export, the store is compared
against the database, so a source object that was truncated or replaced is caught
before it is packaged. At restore, the carried bytes are compared against their own
metadata — same file both sides, so that proves consistency rather than authority,
catching a corrupt or truncated artifact.

### The legacy path, and why it is still ownership-gated

An artifact produced before the above carries no external bytes. For those, the
restore still reads the source object from the store, and everything below applies:
the read is gated on the restoring user currently owning a matching row. Nothing
here is dead code — it is what an older file gets — but it is no longer the path a
new backup takes, and the disaster-recovery cases it cannot serve are the reason the
bytes now travel.

`storage_key` equals the attachment's UUID, and a restore mints a fresh UUID for
every row. Two obvious approaches are both wrong:

- **Remap the key and stop there** (what the code did): metadata points at
  `<new-uuid>` while the object is still at `<old-uuid>`. Every externally stored
  attachment is unreachable after a restore that reported success, and restoring
  the sidecar directory byte-for-byte does not help, because the mismatch is in
  the database.
- **Preserve the old key**: the bytes are not in the backup, so restoring into a
  different user on the same instance hands that user working links to files whose
  contents they were never sent.

So the bytes are **copied**. Before the destructive delete, each external object
is read at its old key, checked against the byte size and SHA-256 the metadata
claims, and written under the new key. The new keys are recorded so a failed
database transaction can remove them again. Old-key objects are left alone: the
same backup may be restored more than once.

**Both keys are derived, never read from the file.** The destination is the
remapped attachment id; the source is the id the backup was written with. The
uploaded `storage_key` is overwritten with the derived value before the insert and
is otherwise ignored, for every provider.

**And the right to read a source object comes from the database, not the file.**
Before any external object is opened, the restoring user must currently own an
attachment with that original id, on the configured provider, whose stored byte
size and SHA-256 equal the ones the uploaded row publishes — read from
`transaction_attachments`, which is still intact because staging runs before the
destructive delete. Integrity is then checked against the *stored* values, so an
object that changed under the row since is caught too. A row that fails any of
this is unrestorable: dropped and counted, with no read attempted.

This is a confidentiality boundary, not tidiness, and it has been got wrong twice
— the second time as the fix for the first:

1. The destination came from `row.storage_key`, and a key the restore did not
   recognise as a remapped id was treated as legacy or operator-chosen: skip the
   load, skip the checksum, skip the copy, on the reasoning that the object already
   sat where the metadata pointed. A crafted backup could therefore name *any*
   syntactically valid key — including one belonging to another tenant — and the row
   was inserted under the uploader's `user_id` without a byte being read.
   Downloading their own metadata returned somebody else's receipt.
2. So both keys were derived from the identifier remap instead, with "a row whose
   id is not in the remap did not come from this backup's graph" as the boundary.
   But the graph is the *uploaded* graph: `collectRowIdRemap` admits every
   UUID-shaped `row.id` in the file, so for a well-formed crafted row that guard
   could not fire. Put the victim's attachment id in `transaction_attachments.id`,
   with the byte size and hash a standard backup publishes beside it, and the
   restore read their object and copied it under the attacker's ownership. The
   uploaded document was authorizing itself.

`assertSafeStorageKey` establishes that a key is a safe *string*; nothing there
establishes that an object is *theirs*. Which field to trust was never the
question: **no unsigned value from the uploaded file can establish ownership — not
a key, not an id, not a checksum, not a byte count. Only a record the server
already holds can.**

The consequence is deliberate and matches what this section already concluded
about preserving the old key: restoring one user's backup into a **different** user
on the same instance skips external attachments rather than disclosing them, and a
fresh instance skips them because the objects are not there. Those attachments show
up in `skippedAttachments`, so the user is told.

An object that cannot be staged — missing, failing its checksum, or written by a
different provider — makes that attachment unrestorable. Refusing the whole
restore over a receipt image is the wrong trade, so the metadata row is dropped
and counted. **The count is reported as `skippedAttachments`, beside `restored`
and never inside it**: the client sums `restored`'s values into a row total, and
rows deliberately not written must not be counted as written.

**The objects the restore displaced are deleted after it commits.** A destructive
restore removes every `transaction_attachments` row the user had, and for `local`
and `s3` the bytes are not in those rows — so they used to stay in the volume or
the bucket forever, referenced by nothing. A receipt or a medical document survived
the replacement of the account it belonged to, remained in whatever backs that
storage up, and could never be found again because the metadata naming it was gone.

The timing and the scope are both load-bearing:

- **After the commit**, because bytes deleted before a transaction that then rolls
  back leave a row promising a download that does not exist — indistinguishable
  from a working attachment. Same rule as `AttachmentsService.remove`.
- **Only keys the target user held**, read before the delete because afterwards
  there is nothing to read them from. Never the old keys named by the uploaded file
  — for the legacy path, those are the source objects it reads, and the same file
  may be restored twice. (The original wording here said a cross-user restore
  "legitimately reads another user's objects as its source". That has not been true
  since the ownership rule above: such a read is now refused. The rule stands for
  the reason that survived, which is repeat restore.)
- **Never a key the restore just staged.** Restoring a backup taken from the same
  account re-uses ids, so a displaced key and a newly written key can be the same
  string.
- **Never a key the backup reads as its source.** A backup taken from this account
  names the keys this account currently holds, so its source objects *are* its
  displaced objects. Deleting them left the artifact naming bytes that no longer
  existed: the first restore worked, and a second restore of the same file skipped
  every attachment and then deleted the copy the first restore had made — losing
  the content entirely while still reporting success.

  When a key is both an orphan and a source, **the source wins**. That knowingly
  keeps an object nothing in the database references, which is what this cleanup
  exists to remove — and it is the right way round: an orphaned copy of the user's
  own receipt costs storage, while a backup that can only be restored once costs
  the receipt.

**The objects the restore staged are discarded when it fails.** Staging writes
bytes to the store *before* the destructive transaction, so a failure between
the first successful write and the transaction's `.catch` would leave those
objects orphaned — bytes no row will ever name again (issue #1094). Two throw
sites are handled so it does not:

- A destination write that fails *inside* the stage loop drops that one
  attachment rather than aborting the whole restore (`tryStageAttachmentObject`):
  it best-effort deletes the object it was writing, logs, and counts the row in
  `skippedAttachments`. The objects already staged this run stay — they are
  referenced by attachments still being restored. Crucially, a **legacy** row's
  source object (`sourceKeys`) is recorded the moment its bytes are read and
  verified, *before* the copy is attempted, so a failed copy on a same-account
  restore never lets the post-commit sweep delete the file's only copy of those
  bytes.
- The displaced-key lookup and the AI-provider re-keying run after staging but
  before the transaction's `.catch` is wired; a throw there discards every staged
  object before re-raising. The discard swallows its own delete failures, so a
  failed tidy-up cannot mask the error that aborted the restore.

**Known gap:** this covers *catchable* failures only. A process crash or kill
between staging and commit still orphans the staged objects, and there is no
sweeper or recovery pass for them yet. It is a bounded storage cost, never a row
promising bytes that are gone, so it is a leak to reclaim rather than a
correctness hazard — tracked as a separate follow-up, not closed by the #1094
fix.

Operationally: for an artifact that carries its own bytes there is nothing to
restore alongside it — that is the point. The sidecar directory or bucket only
matters for an artifact produced before the bytes travelled, and for those it must
be restored **before or alongside** the database *and* the target must still hold
the attachment metadata. If it does not — a fresh instance, a deleted attachment —
those bytes are not recoverable from that artifact at all, whatever order they are
restored in, and the restore reports them in `skippedAttachments`. Take a fresh
backup to get a self-contained one.

**`storage_key` is attacker-chosen input.** It is a column, and a restore writes
it from the uploaded file, so by the time a provider sees it the key may be
anything. Every provider therefore addresses objects through
`assertSafeStorageKey` (`attachments/storage/storage-key.util.ts`), whose
allowlist excludes `.` and `/` so neither a traversal segment nor a separator can
be expressed. The S3 provider lacked this while the local one had it, which made
a crafted key address arbitrary objects in the bucket -- an S3 prefix is a naming
convention, not a boundary. `storage-key.util.spec.ts` asserts every provider in
the module routes its key through the validator, and names the database
provider's exemption (a parameterised primary-key lookup) rather than assuming
it.

## 5. Confirming a destructive restore

`verifyAuthentication` in `backend/src/backup/backup-restore.service.ts` decides
this, and it has exactly three branches — there is no fall-through that proves
nothing:

| Account | Second proof |
|---------|--------------|
| Local, password set | `password`, bcrypt-checked against `passwordHash`. |
| Local, no `passwordHash` (admin-provisioned, reset never completed) | **Refused.** No proof is available, so the restore is not offered — this branch used to fall off the end of the `else if` and require nothing. |
| OIDC | A signed, action-bound, single-use re-authentication artifact from `OidcReauthService`, consumed for the purpose `"restore-backup"`. |

### The OIDC artifact, and what it replaced

Until #1060 this branch read `if (!input.oidcIdToken) reject` and nothing else.
The frontend sent the literal `"oidc-session-confirmed"`, so `x` passed just as
well: the second proof for the most destructive action in the product was
possession of the session that was already required (audit P3-009 / F3RB-007).

What is there now is `OidcReauthService`
(`backend/src/auth/oidc/oidc-reauth.service.ts`), shared by every destructive
surface rather than reimplemented per caller. `GET /auth/oidc/reauth?purpose=…`
sends the user to the identity provider with `prompt=login` and `max_age=0`; the
callback — after `openid-client` has verified state, nonce, issuer, audience and
signature — mints an artifact signed with `JWT_SECRET`, carrying the user id, the
purpose, a one-time `jti`, and a five-minute expiry. `consume(userId, purpose,
token)` checks all of it: signature, type, subject, action, freshness, single
use. Every rejection is the same `401` with the same message, because which check
failed is a fact about the server's state.

Two bindings matter and are easy to lose:

- **Purpose.** `"restore-backup"` is not `"delete-data"`. An artifact minted to
  empty an account must not authorize overwriting it with someone else's file.
- **The round trip.** The pending marker carries a hash of the `state` it was
  issued alongside, so an artifact is bound to *its own* challenge and not merely
  to the fact that one was started. Without that, an ordinary `GET /auth/oidc`
  answered silently from a live SSO session minted a valid artifact for a
  challenge nobody ever answered (FV-001).

`STEP_UP_PURPOSES` is a different mechanism for a different question, and this
path deliberately does not route through it: a step-up token is a second proof,
but for an OIDC account it was itself issued on a client-asserted
`oidcConfirmed: true`. That branch now consumes the same artifact
(`backend/src/auth/step-up/step-up.service.ts`), so there is one implementation of
cryptographic step-up in the repository rather than two.

### Naming: the header does not carry an ID token

The wire names are historical. The header is `X-Restore-OIDC-Token` and the field
is `oidcIdToken` (`backend/src/backup/backup-format.ts`,
`frontend/src/lib/backupApi.ts`), but the value is a Monize-minted
re-authentication artifact, **not** an OIDC ID token — nothing verifies it against
the provider's JWKS, and it would fail if it did. Do not add ID-token claim
checks here on the strength of the name.

### The artifact is spent last, and that is a requirement

The round trip that mints the artifact navigates away from the settings page,
which loses the user's file selection. So a restore that fails for a reason
having nothing to do with identity — a wrong backup password, a truncated file,
a foreign JSON document — must not cost one: the user would have to re-select a
large file *and* re-authenticate, and the retry's honest failure would read as a
spent artifact.

`restoreData` therefore runs everything free first — decrypt, decompress under
the expanded-size ceiling, validate the envelope — and calls
`verifyAuthentication` only once the file is known to be restorable. This is the
one place where section 3's "refuse before the destruction" ordering is refined
rather than simply followed: the check still precedes every write, but it no
longer precedes the checks that cost nothing. `backup.service.spec.ts` pins both
halves — a bad file leaves the artifact spendable, and no `DELETE FROM` reaches
the database on any path where the artifact is refused.

## 6. Size ceilings

Three, for three different failure modes. All configurable, all fail loudly.

| Setting | Bounds | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `BACKUP_RESTORE_LIMIT` | the compressed upload | the half-share peak divided by `PEAK_MULTIPLE` (~a sixth), no floor |
| `BACKUP_RESTORE_EXPANDED_LIMIT` | the **decompressed** payload | a quarter of the container's memory limit |
| `BACKUP_EXPORT_BUFFER_LIMIT` | the artifact a buffered export may accumulate | a quarter of the container's memory limit |

The expanded and buffered defaults are cgroup-derived with a 64 MiB usability
floor, a 1024 MiB cap and a 256 MiB fallback when there is no limit to read. There
are no fixed byte defaults left; the `1024mb` and `512mb` this table used to name
were the numbers that could not fire.

**The upload default has no floor, and that is deliberate (F3R6-005).** A usability
minimum and a safety maximum are different quantities: `max(64 MiB, safe)` let the
floor win, so on a 128 MiB pod it returned 64 MiB whose modeled peak (192 MiB)
exceeded the whole container. The safety bound is the only bound —
`resolvedLimit * PEAK_MULTIPLE <= container * share` for every container size — so a
small pod derives a small, safe upload limit and `warnIfRestoreUploadLimitIsCramped`
says so at startup rather than flooring into a number the pod cannot survive.

The compressed limit bounds nothing about what comes out of gzip: a few hundred
kilobytes of repeated text expands to gigabytes. Decompression is asynchronous
(libuv threadpool) with `maxOutputLength`, so a hostile payload neither allocates
past the ceiling nor blocks the event loop. `JSON.parse` still needs a whole
document — unavoidably — but it now gets a string of bounded length.

The buffered ceiling now applies to two paths, not three: the **automatic** backup,
which writes a file and therefore holds the artifact, and the **support** export,
which holds every table at once to reconcile scaled balances. Both HTTP downloads
stream and are deliberately unbounded. The encrypted download used to be on the
buffered side because AES-GCM's single auth tag needs the whole plaintext before
it can be computed; it writes a framed container now (below), so it streams like
the plain one and a large encrypted export is no longer refused.

**What that ceiling counts changed with it.** It used to bound the uncompressed
JSON, because that JSON really was accumulated — per-table strings, a
concatenated buffer and gzip's output all live at the peak. The buffered path now
holds only the compressed (and, when encrypted, framed) artifact, so the limit is
measured against the bytes actually resident. That is more permissive for
compressible data and stricter for attachments, which are already-compressed
bytes in base64 — and in both directions it is measuring the thing it protects
rather than a proxy for it. The quarter-share default already assumes the payload
is resident more than once, which covers the single `Buffer.concat` at the end.

**Every default is derived from the container's cgroup memory limit**, not fixed.
A ceiling larger than the process it protects cannot fire — the pod is killed
first — and all three used to be exactly that on the chart's 400 MiB backend.

**And the wire bytes are not the cost.** The upload limit was half the container on
the reasoning that a compressed upload is one buffer, unlike the several a buffered
export holds. That was wrong about what happens next: the request goes on to hold
the envelope, `decipher.update`'s output, `Buffer.concat`'s result, the decompressed
payload, the UTF-8 string and the parsed object graph, several of them at once. Half
of 400 MiB on the wire is `PEAK_MULTIPLE` times that at peak, so a *single* legal
request could not fit the pod it was sized for. So the **peak** gets the half share
and the wire gets that divided by `PEAK_MULTIPLE` — one constant, two numbers, and
the aggregate admission budget below is the same half share, so exactly one
full-size restore runs at a time.

`PEAK_MULTIPLE = 3` is a floor, not a measurement: the real multiple depends on
Node's version, the payload's entropy and the object graph's shape. Measuring it
wants the cgroup peak-RSS test that has never run here.

An operator's explicit value always wins, and one too large for the container is
warned about at startup — against the same share the default came from, in the same
units they set, so the derived default never warns about itself and the figure the
warning suggests is one they can paste back.

**The upload limit is the earliest one and therefore the only one that matters for
an oversized request.** `express.raw` buffers the whole body before the controller,
the guards, the authentication lookup, the decryption and every service ceiling, so
a request none of those layers ever sees can still kill the process.

**A per-request ceiling bounds one request, and the process has to survive two.**
The JWT guard and the `ThrottlerGuard` are both Nest guards, so neither runs until
after `express.raw` has buffered the body — nothing downstream can refuse an
allocation that already happened. `createRestoreUploadAdmission`
(`backend/src/backup/restore-upload-admission.ts`) therefore runs as Express
middleware **ahead of** the parser and keeps a process-wide total of the peak bytes
it has promised. Three properties, each of which was wrong once:

- **The claim is the peak, not the wire.** The first version reserved the declared
  `Content-Length`, which counts the smallest of the buffers a restore holds. Three
  60 MiB encrypted uploads declared 180 MiB, fitted a 200 MiB budget, and could pass
  540 MiB in flight. A request now claims `PEAK_MULTIPLE` times its wire bytes.
- **A reservation is held until the work is done, not until the socket shuts.**
  `ServerResponse` emits `close` when the connection ends, which is not the handler
  finishing. Releasing on `close` let a client upload a full body, let the controller
  enter `restoreData`, then hang up — freeing the reservation while the decryption,
  the staging and the SQL were still running, so a second large upload was admitted
  beside the first. The reservation now has a lifecycle: while *receiving*, a `close`
  releases it (nothing downstream took ownership); once the body has arrived, only
  the handler's `finally` (`releaseRestoreReservation`) or a completed response does.
- **A body that never arrives is reclaimed.** The gate necessarily runs before
  authentication, and a chunked request declares no length, so it reserves the whole
  ceiling. Without a deadline an unauthenticated client could trickle or withhold the
  body and hold the recovery path closed for as long as the socket survived — during
  exactly the incident a restore is for. A body that has not arrived inside
  `DEFAULT_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT_MS` gets a 408 and its socket destroyed. The deadline is
  armed only while receiving: a timeout on *processing* would be the
  release-too-early defect with a delay.

What is still not fixed: an unauthenticated client can occupy the budget for that
bounded interval, so it can make a legitimate caller retry. Remaining options, none
implemented, in rough order of preference: a smaller body limit at the ingress ahead
of the process, a two-step restore session that issues a short-lived upload token
after authorization, and streaming the upload through decryption and gzip into a
bounded temporary file or an incremental parser instead of the JavaScript heap. The
last of those is also what would replace `PEAK_MULTIPLE` with a real bound.

**The compressed budget does not bound decompressed memory (F3R6-004).** A small
gzip expands to the `BACKUP_RESTORE_EXPANDED_LIMIT` ceiling regardless of its wire
size, so a request's *processing* peak — decompressed payload, string, parsed graph
— is independent of the compressed bytes the upload gate reserved against. Four
1 MiB uploads that each expand to the ~100 MiB expanded limit pass upload admission
on their small claims and then hold ~400 MiB between them. So restore *processing*
is capped separately: `restoreProcessingGate`
(`backend/src/backup/restore-processing-gate.ts`) admits only as many concurrent
restores as fit the container. The service acquires a slot before decompression and
releases it in a `finally`, and on the default pod the count is one — a second
restore waits rather than decompressing beside the first.

The slot count budgets against the numbers that actually cost (F3R7-002): each
restore's peak is `PEAK_MULTIPLE` × the **resolved** `BACKUP_RESTORE_EXPANDED_LIMIT`
`gunzip` enforces — so an operator override is accounted for, where the earlier
version modeled every restore at the derived default and admitted five 2 GiB
restores on a 16 GiB pod — and the ordinary process baseline
(`restoreProcessBaselineBytes`) is subtracted before dividing. When one modeled
restore does not fit at all, the count is `0`: the gate still floors capacity at
one, because a running process must be able to attempt a restore, but startup warns
that a restore may exceed memory and names the levers (raise the container limit, or
lower `BACKUP_RESTORE_EXPANDED_LIMIT`). The cap is robust to `PEAK_MULTIPLE` being an
estimate — serialising to one is safe under any true multiple *as long as one
restore fits*, which is exactly the condition the warning surfaces when it does not.
The baseline and the multiple are both estimates, not measurements; settling them
needs the cgroup peak-RSS test that has never run here.

**A budget checked after the allocation is not a budget.** The support export
always discards `attachment_blobs`, which is base64 — thirty 10 MiB receipts are
~400 MiB of text — and `collectRawExport` loaded it anyway before any ceiling was
consulted. It now takes a `skipTables` set, and a test asserts the support path
passes `ALWAYS_EXCLUDED_TABLES` — and, since attachment bytes now travel, that the
augmentation does not read a single object off disk for a table the caller is going
to discard either.

### The export is bounded by its chunk size, not by the dataset (F3R6-001, issue #1070)

This was open through five audits under four labels, and the shape of it never
changed: the export was described as streaming because it wrote a table at a
time, while each individual step held something whole. All of it is now a pull
pipeline, and each stage bounds the one before it:

- **Rows** arrive through a database cursor declared inside the snapshot
  (`export-cursor.ts`), so a table contributes a batch at a time rather than one
  `manager.query` result the size of the table.
- **`attachment_blobs` fetches one row at a time**, because one row is one whole
  base64-encoded object. That batch size is the number of attachments resident at
  once, and a source guard fails if it is removed.
- **The document is serialised per row** under a 256 KiB chunk budget
  (`export-json-stream.ts`) instead of one `JSON.stringify` per table, which used
  to make the array and a string of the array live at the same instant.
- **External objects are opened one at a time** and dropped once written, rather
  than accumulated into one array of base64 before serialisation began.
- **The writer resolves each write only when the pipeline has taken it**
  (`export-writer.ts`), so a slow client stops the database reads instead of
  letting a queue grow behind the socket, and a client that disappears unwinds the
  snapshot rather than pinning it.
- **The encrypted download streams too**, through the framed container below.

What is irreducible: one row. A 10 MiB attachment is 13.6 MiB of base64 whatever
the budget says, because a row is serialised whole. The floor is therefore the
largest single attachment, not the largest table.

**The framed encrypted container (`MZBE` v2).** AES-GCM's auth tag covers the whole
message, so a single-tag envelope cannot emit a byte until the last byte of
plaintext exists — which is exactly why the encrypted export buffered. v2 seals
256 KiB frames, each with its own tag, following the STREAM construction: the
nonce is `prefix || counter || finalFlag`, and the header is additional
authenticated data for every frame. So a frame cannot be reordered, duplicated,
moved between files, or **dropped from the end** — the frame that would become
last was sealed as non-final and is opened expecting the final flag. Truncation is
the failure a naive chunked format gets wrong, and half a backup that decrypts
cleanly is worse than one that does not decrypt at all. v1 envelopes still open:
every backup a user already holds is one, and the support export still writes one
because it assembles in memory anyway.

**What this does not settle.** The claim is bounded peak RSS, and the honest
measurement of that is the cgroup-constrained harness this repository still does
not have (`DR-F3R6-002` / `DR-F3R7-003`). What the suite proves instead is the
property the claim rests on — the export never has the whole of anything in hand:
reads happen in batches, objects are opened one at a time between writes, bytes go
out before the last table is read, and a blocked client stops the reads
(`export-streaming.spec.ts`). `PEAK_MULTIPLE` on the **restore** side is untouched
and still an estimate: the restore's `express.raw` upload is buffered before any
of our code runs, so bounding it is a different change with a different shape.

## 7. Automatic backups on disk

- **Per-user directory.** Each user's artifacts go in a server-computed
  subdirectory of the root, named by their user id. Filenames carry only
  frequency and date, so isolation has to come from the path — and retention only
  ever enumerates one user's directory. Files sitting directly in a root predate
  this, carry no owner in their names, and are left exactly where they are.
- **Crash-atomic writes.** Temp file in the same directory, `fsync`, atomic
  rename, `fsync` the directory. A final filename never refers to a partial file,
  and a failed write leaves the previous artifact intact. Stale temp files are
  swept separately from retention, because a partial write is not a backup and
  counting one would silently shorten the retention window.
- **Confined destinations.** `BACKUP_ALLOWED_ROOTS` (defaulting to
  `BACKUP_CONTAINER_DIR`) bounds every user-influenced path, canonically — a
  symlink inside a permitted directory cannot lead out of one.
- **Completeness is part of an artifact's identity, not a note beside it
  (F3RB-001, issue #1069).** A run that knows its artifact is incomplete publishes
  it as `monize-backup-partial-<date>.<ext>`, in its own retention tier; nothing
  named `daily-`, `weekly-` or `monthly-` is ever written by such a run. The name
  is chosen *after* the export, from what the export found, because
  `writeFileAtomic` replaces a final name by design: choosing it first destroyed
  that day's complete artifact and then recorded `partial` in the settings row,
  with nothing left to preserve. Retention then read the ordinary name and counted
  it as a complete daily, so `retentionDaily = 3` over three partial days could
  keep two partials and delete three complete artifacts.

  The tier is what makes both halves hold at once: a partial run may delete
  **older partial artifacts and nothing else**, so a storage outage cannot fill
  the volume with them and cannot cost a single complete copy. Partials are kept
  to `retentionDaily` — the same depth, counted separately — because they arrive
  on the same cadence; the two counts never draw on each other.

  Retention classifies from the filename alone. That is deliberate rather than
  lazy: the settings row is on one instance, and an encrypted artifact's envelope
  claim is inside the ciphertext, so a rescan after a restart has nothing else to
  read. The envelope claim (section 4) is the durable copy for everything that is
  not retention.

  **Artifacts written before this change keep their `daily-` names and keep being
  counted as complete.** A pre-existing ordinary-named partial cannot be told from
  a complete one — its completeness was never in the file, and for an encrypted
  artifact could not be read back without the user's password. The fix stops new
  losses; it does not reclassify history it cannot inspect.

  What it does *not* yet fix: `Run Backup Now` still reports a partial run through
  the ordinary "Backup created: `<filename>`" toast, so the only thing telling the
  user is `partial-` in the name it shows them. The service returns a message
  saying more (`runManualBackup`) and the frontend does not use it.

On Kubernetes this needs `backend.persistence.backups.enabled` (see
`helm/README.md`). With a read-only root filesystem and no mount, a schedule
reports errors forever while the UI shows it as configured.

## 8. Cross-version and cross-instance limits

Known and unresolved; none of these is a bug report waiting to be filed:

- **Format version is strict equality.** Only `1` is accepted, rejected before
  any deletion. There is no compatibility window and no offline upgrader; define
  one before incrementing. This is the `version` field *inside* the document; the
  encrypted **envelope** carries its own version and accepts both containers
  (§6), which is a separate number and deliberately not strict.
- **A framed envelope does not open on an older instance.** Encrypted downloads
  are `MZBE` v2 as of issue #1070, and a build from before it recognises only v1 —
  it reports the file as not being in the encrypted Monize format. Restoring
  backwards across that boundary means an unencrypted export, or restoring on a
  build at least as new as the one that produced the file. The reverse direction
  is fine: every version reads v1.
- **AI provider keys written by an older build do not cross instances.** Keys now
  travel decrypted and are re-encrypted on arrival (§1), so a current artifact is
  portable. One made before that carries `api_key_enc` under the exporting
  instance's `AI_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, and restores onto any other instance populated
  and unreadable; so does any key the exporting instance could not decrypt
  itself. Re-entering the key is the only recovery.

  What *was* a defect is that this happened silently. The column is non-null, so
  every check that asks "is a key configured?" answered yes and the provider row
  drew a masked key; the only symptom was that AI calls failed. The restore now
  counts those rows — plus any it could not re-encrypt because this server has no
  `AI_ENCRYPTION_KEY` — and reports `unusableAiProviderKeys` beside `restored`:
  beside, never inside, for the same reason as `skippedAttachments` (§4), since
  the client sums `restored` into a row total and these rows *were* written. It
  is the key inside them that did not survive. `AiService.testConnection` says
  the same thing on demand, in place of the generic "check your provider
  settings", which is advice about settings that are in fact correct.

  Both the re-encryption and the count run before the restore's transaction:
  `AiEncryptionService`'s derivation is `scryptSync`, tens of milliseconds per
  key, which does not belong inside the transaction holding every one of the
  user's rows — and does not belong on a list endpoint at all, which is why
  `getConfigs` still reports only whether the column is populated.
- **Delegation is reset.** `account_delegates`, `account_delegate_grants` and
  `delegate_account_favourites` are excluded by design, and cascade away when
  accounts are deleted. A restore therefore removes existing grants and
  favourites. Whether that security reset is the intended product behaviour is
  undecided.
- **`ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` counts optimistically.** `insertRows` increments its
  counter per attempted row, not per affected row, and there is no post-restore
  cardinality or closure check. UUID remapping removes ordinary primary-key
  collisions, but a natural or composite-key conflict would be reported as
  restored.

## 9. The support (de-identified) backup

`docs/support-backup.md` is authoritative. Two things belong here because they are
restore contract, not privacy policy:

- A support backup restores through the same path as any other and is logged as
  such. Its amounts are scaled by a hidden factor, so scaled balances must not
  later be mistaken for corruption.
- Custom currency codes are pseudonymised, and every reference is rewritten
  through `CURRENCY_REFERENCE_COLUMNS`. A reference left behind is a foreign-key
  violation, which would make the artifact de-identified *and* useless.
- `currencies.created_by_user_id` is rewritten to the exporting user before the
  identifier remap. The row has no `id` column, so the row-id sweep that remaps
  every other identifier never sees it — and since the export includes every code
  the user's data references whoever defined it, the column can hold another
  user's real UUID. Two support files from two users of one instance would then be
  correlatable by the creator id they share, which is the one thing the remap
  exists to prevent.
